# What to Do Immediately After Death

## Getting a Legal Pronouncement of Death

- If under hospice care, call the hospice.
- If in a medical facility, they'll take care of it.
- If not in medical care or hospice, call 911. If there's "do not resuscitate order," have it ready to present to the paramedics so they don't attempt resuscitation.

## Arranging for the Body to Be Transported

If there is no autopsy required, the body can be picked up by a funeral home, mortuary, or crematorium. Cost is ~$500.

## Contact Others

It might be good to draw up a list ahead of time, with contact information ready to go.

## Preparations

- [ ] Have a copy of medical advance directive accessible.
- [ ] List of people to contact, with contact info.
- [ ] Decide who's going to pick up the body (see funeral arrangements).
